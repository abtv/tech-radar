# tech-radar

## Description

Technology Radar is a web application which helps you to be aware about modern trends in programming. 
One look is worth thousand words. Just follow to http://tech-radar.github.io
I prepared this project for my talk `Full stack Clojure in production`. I would appreciate any ideas and questions.

## How to build the app

1. install-env.sh contains everything you need to setup environment for tech-radar under Ubuntu server.
2. build-release-all.sh builds backend and frontend applications and packs them into release.zip file.
3. tech-radar.conf file contains upstart config

## It's not perfect... yet
I had not so much time to make this project. Backend is mostly ok, but frontend is just a very early implementation. I'm going to use Om.next for frontend.
